## Introduction
Many large corporations already use 3D graphics to showcase their products. so I built my own ThreeJS 3D product website and infuse it with the power of artificial intelligence!

- React Three Fiber - a popular library for creating 3D graphics with ThreeJS in React

Also,
- Load, create and customize stunning 3D models and geometries with various lights, as well as understand the 3D world with a camera and positioning of an object in space.
- Make your code reusable and scalable using Higher Order Components (HOCs) and other industry-standard best practices
- Add custom color and file support.
- Generate and use images through DALLE AI
- Download the resulting t-shirt model image
